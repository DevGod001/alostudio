The AI engineer successfully progressed Alostudio from an MVP to a more feature-rich application. Initial work involved establishing the core React-FastAPI-MongoDB stack, implementing booking, and basic admin features. Subsequent phases focused on UI/UX enhancements, mobile responsiveness, and critical bug fixes. Key decisions included shifting from modal dialogs to inline expandable forms for admin actions due to persistent UI/event blocking issues, moving sensitive credentials to environment variables, and refining the admin session logic. The most recent focus has been on building a robust frame ordering system, involving significant backend schema and endpoint updates, and corresponding frontend UI/logic changes for payments, status tracking, and delivery options. The engineer systematically addressed user feedback, iteratively refining features like image galleries and booking workflows, often through detailed debugging and refactoring to resolve complex frontend interaction issues.

<product_requirements>
Alostudio is a professional AI-driven photo and video studio requiring online booking for makeup, photography, and video sessions with detailed service descriptions, prices (admin-adjustable), and images. It mandates a 25%/60% deposit via manual CashApp verification and admin approval. A key requirement is real-time availability and user dashboard access via email/number authentication. The admin dashboard needs robust booking, payment approval, and earnings management. Core brand colors are pink and black. The app must be fully mobile-responsive.

Recent additions requested by the user include:
- Admin ability to upload session photos/videos for completed bookings, viewable in the user's dashboard.
- A comprehensive user photo gallery with image zoom and download functionality (without conflicting selection).
- A robust frame ordering system where users select photos (uploaded or studio), choose frame sizes, submit payment via CashApp, see pending admin review status, and admin manages approval, status updates (ready for pickup/shipped), and delivery fees/pickup addresses.
- Persistent admin login.
- Admin earnings wallet.
- Fixes for UI/UX flows, including non-functional buttons and mobile tab overlaps.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the comprehensive frame ordering system on the frontend. The backend () has already been significantly updated to support the new  model (including , , , and detailed  like , , ), admin settings for , and new endpoints for frame order creation with payment, payment submission, and admin management of frame order status and delivery.

On the frontend, the  state in  has been updated to include  and . The  function has been modified to integrate the new payment-integrated workflow, prompting for CashApp reference and setting the initial status. The engineer was in the process of rewriting the Frame Orders section within  to display the detailed status and delivery options for each frame order. The last observed action was adding the  function and other helpers, which resulted in a lint error because  was not yet defined, indicating that the new frontend components for detailed frame order display are still under active development.
