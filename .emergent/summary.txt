<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the Alostudio application from scratch, iteratively refining it based on user feedback. The initial phase focused on establishing a full-stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) MVP with core booking functionalities for makeup, photography, and video sessions, including a manual CashApp payment workflow and admin approvals. Significant effort was then directed towards enhancing the UI/UX, ensuring mobile responsiveness across devices, and fixing various navigational and display issues, such as ensuring all service tabs were visible on mobile and fixing hero section scroll behavior. A persistent challenge involved correctly implementing admin access via a hidden route and removing the Made with Emergent badge. The latest phase, still in progress, involves expanding the application with advanced features like an admin earnings wallet, a comprehensive user photo gallery, and a robust frame ordering system tied to user-uploaded or studio photos, alongside improving admin session persistence.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation and comprehensive testing of the Order Frame workflow (user selection from gallery/upload, payment, admin approval).
- Ensuring the user dashboard (My Bookings) fully displays photos and pending jobs.
- Comprehensive testing of admin session persistence (admin not logged out for an hour after refresh).
- Complete integration and testing of the  component with real earnings data.
- Overall flow and functionality of newly added features (photo gallery, frame orders, admin wallet, session persistence) needs thorough verification.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on integrating the newly introduced comprehensive photo studio features into the frontend. The backend  had already been updated to include API endpoints for uploading photos, managing user galleries, handling frame orders, and tracking admin earnings, along with changes for admin session management. On the frontend, new React components like  and  were created to handle these functionalities. The current task involved integrating these components into the main  file and ensuring all new service types and features are correctly reflected and handled. Specifically, the last action was updating the  function in  to properly display icons for the new service categories, indicating that the new features are in the process of being wired up and made visible/functional in the UI.

<optional_next_step>
Continue updating the  function to handle new service types and then proceed with thoroughly testing the newly integrated photo gallery, frame ordering, admin wallet, and admin session persistence features.
